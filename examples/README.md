# Example Projects

This folder contains example projects from the [official Kendo UI for Angular documentation](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components) in a shared [Angular CLI workspace](https://angular.io/guide/file-structure).

Additional sample applications that cannot use the same workspace are located in the [`examples-standalone`](../examples-standalone) folder.

## Starting Projects

The instructions for getting up and running with each sample project can be found in its `README.md` file in the [`projects` folder](./projects).

## Hosted Examples

Currently, the example on [integrating Kendo UI for Angular with Progressive Web Applications](https://telerik.github.io/kendo-angular/integration-pwa) is deployed on GitHub pages.

## Creating a New Project

1. Create a new sample application by running `ng generate application <application-name>`.
1. In `angular.json`, add the Kendo UI Default theme to the `styles` section of the application.

## Further Help

To get more help on the Angular CLI, use `ng help` or check out the [Angular CLI `README.md` file](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
